#1. Print Hello World!

#2. Create three different boolean variables named wifi, login, and admin.

#3. Create a separate integer variable that denotes the number of times
#someone with admin credentials has logged in.

#4. Create a nested if statement that checks to see if wifi is true,
#login is true, and admin is true. If they are all true, print a
#welcome message and increase the integer variable by one. If one of them
#is false, print an error message telling them which one they are "missing".

print("Hello World!")

login = True
admin = True
admin_login = 0

    if login == True:
        if admin == True:
            admin_login += 1
            print("welcome administrator")
        else:
            print('no administrator privledges')
    else:
        print('login incorrect')
